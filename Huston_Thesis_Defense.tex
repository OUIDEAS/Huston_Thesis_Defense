\abstract  {Gravel roads lack standardized features such as curbs or painted lines, presenting detection challenges to autonomous vehicles. Global Positioning Service (GPS) and high resolution maps may not be reliable for navigation of gravel roads, as some may only be width of the vehicle and GPS may not be accurate enough. Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) based on scanning LiDAR data may be insufficient for navigating on gravel roads as there may not be enough geometrically distinct features for reliable scan matching. This work will examine a method of classifying scanning LiDAR data spatial and remission features for explicit detection of unmarked gravel road surfaces. Exploration of terrain classification using high resolution scanning LiDAR data of these road surfaces may allow for predicting gravel road boundary locations potentially enabling confident autonomous operations on gravel roads. The principal outcome of this work was a method for gravel road detection using LiDAR data for the purpose of predicting road boundary locations. Random Decision Forests were trained using scanning LiDAR data terrain classification to detect unmarked gravel and asphalt surfaces. It was found that a true-positive accuracy for gravel and asphalt surfaces was 67.54\% and 87.05\% respectively at an estimated rate of 13.19 ms per 360 degree scan. Overlapping results between manually projected and actual road surface areas resulted in 91.67\% intercepting gravel road detection accuracy. Detection of unmarked road surfaces would increase the operational region capabilities of self driving vehicles considerably by allowing autonomous operations on 1.5 million miles of previously undetected roads.}

\section{Problem Statement and Motivation}
{
	
	{Autonomous vehicles have difficulty detecting rural unpaved gravel roads, which make up for 34.8\% \cite{road_stats_2} of all road surfaces in the United States. Some nations have predominately unpaved road networks, such as India, where 70.7\% of all roads by mile are categorized as unpaved \cite{malik_lal_2019}. Detection of gravel roads may allow for expansion of current civilian autonomous vehicle capabilities as well as introduce opportunities for industries that operate in rural areas. Global Positioning Service (GPS) and high resolution maps cannot be relied upon for navigation of rural roads, as some gravel roads may only be width of the vehicle and GPS is not accurate enough or may not have a reliable signal for precision driving \cite{noauthor_gpsgov_nodate}. Current methods of road surface analysis rely on cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors to detect standardized road features, however on gravel roads such attributes are non-existent \cite{skorseth_gravel_nodate}. Systems that rely on cameras may fail when analyzing gravel roads, as these lack visual cues such as painted lane markings \cite{crisman_scarf_1993} and may in fact closely resemble the surrounding terrain. LiDAR point cloud processing systems depend upon distinct geometric features, most commonly curbs \cite{yadav_extraction_2017,liu_new_2013,qiu_fast_2016,fernandes_road_2014,seker_experiments_nodate,yang_semi-automated_2013,miyazaki_line-based_2014,hervieu_road_2013,smadja_road_nodate}, however as curbs are not installed on rural gravel roads \cite{skorseth_gravel_nodate} this method breaks down. Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) scan matching analytically compares two point cloud data sets to track current position, however this model relies on distinct geometric features, and suffers when distinguishing between terrain types making it insufficient for determining road boundaries \cite{biber_normal_2003}. Using 2D projection of planes unto a 3D point cloud of a road surface is an alternative approach, but likewise requires curbs or painted lines for road boundary definition \cite{fernandes_road_2014, borkar_robust_2009-1, guo_lane_2015}. Instead, using cameras and LiDAR may overcome difficulties in achieving real-time detection of gravel road surfaces using terrain classification to discover road boundaries, allowing for autonomous operations that do not rely upon match enabling processes and traditional visual cues. }
	
	{Detection of gravel road surfaces may rely on the surface properties of the road without relying on distinct markings or topographical features. Surface roughness is a measurable property that may be used to characterize a gravel road, as they are typically consistent with gravel type used \cite{skorseth_gravel_nodate} which may be exploited in a search and compare function, and is distinct from grass and other ground types \cite{wan_road_2007, levi_3d_2012_light, levi_3d_2012_terrain}. Surface roughness properties may be derived from processing LiDAR data from an aerial and surface level perspective \cite{wan_road_2007, levi_3d_2012_light, levi_3d_2012_terrain, pollyea_experimental_2012,rychkov_computational_2012,lague_accurate_2013,brubaker_use_2013,turner_estimation_2014,campbell_lidar-based_2017,shepard_roughness_2001,tegowski_statistical_2016,sock_probabilistic_2016,milenkovic_roughness_2018,yadav_extraction_2017, yadav_rural_2018}. Real time description of surface noise based on incoming LiDAR data, then subsequent comparison to a standard, is a possible alternative that may allow for computationally efficient road surface detection. Overlaying camera imagery data with LiDAR allows for assigning incoming LiDAR data with color information, potentially increasing efficiency by narrowing the search area. Evaluation of the detection model will rely principally upon accuracy and processing time, as a moving vehicle must obtain reliable information of the road surface in a timely manner in order to inform trajectory updates, or else risk suffering an accident. Detection of gravel road surfaces would increase the capabilities of self driving vehicles considerably, allowing autonomous operations on 1.5 million miles \cite{road_stats_2} of previously undetected rural roads. \textbf{Problem Statement: Determine a processing method for increasing road detection precision of unmarked gravel rural roads.}

\chapter{Objectives}

\section{Objectives}

	{Two objectives of exploring a LiDAR-based real time detection of a gravel road were met. The first objective was to determine a mathematical model describing LiDAR data scanning an unmarked road surface. Road surface roughness of the physical LiDAR data was analyzed and described in a mathematical model for terrain classification based gravel road detection. The second objective was to classify stretches of unmarked gravel and chipseal roads using the terrain classification algorithm derived in Objective 1.}

	\subsection{Objective 1}
	
		{\textbf{Objective Statement: Explore Identify model of adequately describing and simulating a gravel road.} Physical data of a gravel road and a paved road with an intersecting gravel road was gathered using a sensor platform that includes LiDAR and RGB cameras. Regression analysis projection of two dimensional planes using incoming point cloud data to provide a reference point for spacial analysis was explored. Random Decision Forests was explored for classification of a scanning LiDAR spatial and remission data of a gravel road surface. Completion of Objective 1 was accomplished by achieving the goal of gravel road detection. Success was measured by determining the accuracy of detection and the processing time. The outcome of Objective 1 was a method of detecting a physical gravel road with a LiDAR sensor.}

	\subsection{Objective 2}

		{\textbf{Automate classification of consecutive LiDAR scans of unmarked chipseal and gravel roads and verify using manually defined road boundaries.} LiDAR, GPS, and IMU data of physical unmarked gravel and chipseal roads was collected. Road surface area was predicted using the model developed in Objective 1. GPS and IMU data allowed for the creation of transformation matrices required for stitching consecutive LiDAR scans. Stitched results were then scored by comparing them to manually defined road surfaces. Completion of Objective II was accomplished by achieving the goal of classifying consecutive LiDAR scans of unmarked chipseal and gravel roads. Success of Objective II was measured by determining the accuracy of detection and processing time. The outcome of Objective II is a method of detecting a stretch of an unmarked asphalt road with intercepting gravel roads with a Scanning LiDAR sensor.}


\chapter{Literature Review}

	\section{Introduction to Literature Review}
		
		{Robust road surface detection is necessary for safe and reliable autonomous operations, however while many solutions excel in urban environments, most are inoperable in rural areas. The following literature review will provide a high level overview of the current road surface detection models and terrain classification as well as providing an overview of the tools that will be used in this project for road surface detection.}
		
	\section{Road Detection Methods Overview}{
	
		{Current LiDAR based road surface detection models may be categorized into two methodologies. Firstly is the analysis of road surface properties, which considers aspects such as topology and surface roughness. Detection based on road surface smoothness was studied by segmenting the point cloud into candidate road surface regions and searching for elevation jumps \cite{liu_new_2013}. Secondly is the detection of roadside curbs, which relies upon the height difference between the road surface and the curb for road edge detection. LiDAR point density at a curb's upper and lower edges can be used to indicate road edges \cite{ibrahim_curb-based_2012}. Fernandes et al. propose a road surface detection method using LiDAR \cite{fernandes_road_2014}, by projecting a 2D reference plane unto the 3D LiDAR data. In this study, road surfaces are assumed to be flat regions between two elevated regions such as curbs. Cameras have been used to supplement LiDAR point cloud data, which can implement 3D colored elevation maps to match pre-stored geometry data in a modified Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm \cite{manz_detection_2011}. Supervised Classification Applied to Road Following (SCARF) is an algorithm that detects road surfaces based on color differences between the road and the surrounding terrain \cite{crisman_scarf_1993}. It was found that difficulties arise when detecting road surfaces in less colored environments \cite{crisman_scarf_1993,manz_detection_2011}.}
		
		{Real time processing of rural gravel roads cannot rely on normalized, consistent features found on urban roads such as curbs, as rural roads lack these features \cite{skorseth_gravel_nodate}. As such, many of the proposed models are rendered unserviceable, as they rely on curbs or painted lines to offer distinctions in data sets \cite{yadav_extraction_2017,liu_new_2013,qiu_fast_2016,fernandes_road_2014,seker_experiments_nodate,yang_semi-automated_2013,miyazaki_line-based_2014,hervieu_road_2013,smadja_road_nodate}.} 
		
		{Further limitations are imposed when considering data set size and processing speed. Real time analysis of road surfaces dictates that trajectory updates to the vehicle in motion must have a rapid update rate, which prohibits the relatively lengthy collection of large data sets or any form of post-processing. Proposed methods \cite{yadav_extraction_2017,yadav_road_2018,yadav_rural_2018,yadav_pole-shaped_2015,miyazaki_line-based_2014,yang_semi-automated_2013,liu_new_2013,qiu_fast_2016} do not indicate the minimum number of points required for road surface detection, however large data sets numbering many millions of points are used in those studies. Computation efficiency of road surface detection is mentioned only by a few studies, such as the one completed by Yadav et al \cite{yadav_road_2018}. Principal component analysis on the height of each LiDAR data point was proposed to detect a straight, curb-less rural road with low computation time \cite{yadav_road_2018}. However a computational time of 24 minutes was required to process a 156 meter stretch of road, rendering real time detection impossible.}

	\section{Terrain Classification}{
		
		{Classification of the surrounding environment is an integral part to the proposed work, as differentiation of gravel road surfaces and surrounding terrain is necessary to determine road boundaries. Terrain classification is the analysis of the ground surface in order to specify the ground surface type \cite{laible_3d_2012,laible_terrain_2013,laible_map_building,rasmussen_combining_2002,reymann_improving_2015,walas_terrain_2014,wietrzykowski_boosting_2014,wang_road_nodate}. Current literature proposes multiple methods of terrain classification using LiDAR and RGB cameras, and may be roughly broken into two areas of application. Traversability or trafficability is the analysis of generally unstructured environments that includes obstacles or rough terrain types for autonomous vehicle path finding solutions  \cite{schilling_geometric_2017,ojeda_terrain_2006,coombs_driving_2000,stavens_self-supervised_nodate,belter_rough_2010,bartoszyk_terrain-aware_2017,noauthor_fusion_nodate,li_rugged_2019,wilson_terrain_2014,siva_robot_2019}. While this research may be useful for detection of obstacles on the road for the proposed work, it is assumed that the roads that will be studied will be free of obstacles. Edmond et al. propose a method to detect terrain type through implementation of vehicle vibration, however this method is limited to what the vehicle is currently driving over and thus cannot detect intercepting gravel roads \cite{dupont_online_2008}. Filitchkin et al. propose a method to detect terrain type using a downward orientated camera for use in a small robotic dog, however this method was not extended to explore terrain surrounding the robot \cite{filitchkin_feature_based_2012}. Weska et al. propose a method of terrain classification through arieal photography, however the implementation on a road vehicle was not explored \cite{weszka_comparative_1976}. Obstacle detection using a single axis LiDAR was studied \cite{manduchi_obstacle_2005}, however this method cannot detect road surfaces, only detect obstacles in roads. Terrain classification using cameras for use in off-road robots was studied \cite{walch_offroad_2022}, however the method focuses on terrain traversability, furthermore ambient conditions may lower classification accuracy \cite{levi_3d_2012_light}.}
		
		{LiDAR and camera based real-time terrain classification was studied by projecting a 2D plane unto the point cloud data using a variant of Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) called M-estimator Sample Consensus (MSAC) \cite{mijakovska_generating_2014} that is built for a more robust result \cite{laible_3d_2012,laible_map_building,laible_terrain_2013}. After segmenting the plane into cells, roughness and intensity histograms were analyzed on a per-cell basis. Markov Random Field (MRF) \cite{chellappa_classification_1985} and Conditional Random Field (CRF) \cite{wallach_conditional_nodate} were compared in their ability to compare individual cells with neighboring cells. Comparison with neighboring cells increases classification type accuracy, as adjacent cell are likely to have the same terrain type \cite{haselich_terrain_2011,zhao_fusion_2014}. It was found that CRF was better suited for classification. Random Forest (RF) classification showed good results for identification of analysis of LiDAR and camera data \cite{breiman_random_2001}, and was used to predict cell terrain into one of five types, including gravel and grass. It was found that characterizing the LiDAR intensity as Gaussian distributed noise yielded poor results with only a 49.5\% true positive rate, however a low-resolution LiDAR was used. Higher resolution LiDAR that produces a high density point cloud, such as the Velodyne VLP-32 that will be used in the proposed work \cite{vlp_32c}, may allow for better terrain classification with Gaussian characterization of return intensity and spatial data. While capable of real-time classification of terrain type, this method was not employed in road identification and used a low resolution LiDAR system.}
		
		{Neural networks and similar machine learning tools may be used in terrain and road identification. Road classification with LiDAR spacial and remission features was completed with Neural Network classifier, Naive Bayes classifier, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) \cite{wang_road_nodate,wang_two-stage_2018}. Gravel roads were successfully identified with a 98.5\% true positive identification rate, however data collected required post processing. MATLAB's Neural Network tools were used in autonomous road identification using LiDAR and Camera data \cite{rasmussen_combining_2002}, however post processing was required, with unknown computational time.  Terrain classification was completed using Support Vector Machine (SVM), a classification algorithm where a line is drawn between two different categories to differentiate between them \cite{breiman_random_2001}. Histograms and averages for image hue, saturation, and color value, along with LiDAR intensity were used as points of classification for different terrain types. Although a 96\% true positive rate was reported for a rocky surface, the overall process was computationally expensive with 1.8 seconds per image. }
		
		{Terrain classification using Random Forest classification trained on scanning LiDAR data was used to predict road surface area.}

	\section{Method of Least Squares Planar Fit}{
	
		{Method of Least Squares (MLS) was be used to project a two dimensional plane unto a point cloud, facilitating examination of points by providing a frame of reference \cite{miller_method_nodate, gojcic_perfect_2019}. Method of least-squares analyses regression to approximate the best fit to a data set. Planar fitting of three dimensional points of the form $(x,y, f(x,y))$ assumes that the z-component is dependent on the x and y components. Using ${(x_i, y_i, z_i)}_{i=1}^m$, $A$, $B$, and $C$ may be determined such that the projected plane $z = Ax + By + C$ best fits the given points. Error is only measured in the z-direction and is defined as $(0,0,0) = \nabla E(A, B, C) = 2\sum_{i=1}^{m}[(Ax_i + By_i + C) - z_i](x_i,y_i,1)$. Thus:}
	
		\begin{equation}
			\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
					\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i z_i \\
					\sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i z_i \\
					\sum_{i=1}^{m} z_i \\
					
			\end{array} } \right]
			=
			\left[ {\begin{array}{ccc}
					\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i^2 		& \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i y_i 		& \sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i \\
					\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i y_i 		& \sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i^2 			& \sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i \\
					\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_i 			& \sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i 			& \sum_{i=1}^{m} 1   \\
			\end{array} } \right]
			\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
					A\\

			\label{FOV}
		\end{equation}
	
		{Method of least-squares may be used to project a two dimensional plane unto a point cloud in order to create a reference point for analysis of LiDAR spatial data.}
		
		{MATLAB does not include a Method of Least Squares Planar Fit function, however one was easily sourced from the MathWorks File Exchange \cite{noauthor_object-oriented_nodate}. Plane projection using this library was accomplished (Figure \ref{fig:Method_Least_Squares_Plane_Proj}), and yielded the normal vector $[a,b,c]$ and the height above the origin $d$.}

	\section{Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)}{
	
		{RANSAC is an iterative algorithm that is designed to handle large numbers of outliers in the sample data set \cite{derpanis_overview_nodate,yaniv_random_2010,fischler_random_1987,cantzler_random_nodate}, and may be used to fit a two dimensional plane unto a three dimensional point cloud. RANSAC may be described as a two step process that may be repeated until a desired level of accuracy is achieved. First, randomly selected samples from the data set are fitted with a model and the corresponding model parameters are determined. Number of samples corresponds to the desired model, therefore three points will be selected for plane fitting. Second, the entire data set is examined with a cost function to determine consistency with the model. Number of points within the model or inliers is a common method of determining the best estimate \cite{cantzler_random_nodate}. A simplified two dimensional example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Ransac_2D_Example}. RANSAC model parameters are not generally precise in order to decrease computational load, therefore necessitating a secondary algorithm to analyze a subset of the point cloud. Method of least squares is one such algorithm commonly employed for determining the best fit for the model.}

Poor fitment (left) is shown with minimal number of points within the user-defined threshold area. Better fitment (right) is shown with maximum number of points within the user-defined threshold area.}
			\label{fig:Ransac_2D_Example}
		\end{figure}

		{While RANSAC provides a robust estimation for model parameters, the primary disadvantage is potentially high computationally load \cite{yaniv_random_2010}. Computational efficiency was increased by altering the parameters to allow a more lax fit of the model. Restricting the number of iterations decreased the likelihood of having the best fit while decreasing the computation time.}

	\section{Random Decision Forests (RDF)}\label{RDF_SECT}{
		
		{Random Decision Forests is a supervised machine learning method that operates on a set of decision trees \cite{ho_random_1995}. Random Decision Forests have been shown to be useful with handling LiDAR data sets \cite{breiman_random_2001}, and have been employed in terrain classification \cite{laible_3d_2012,laible_map_building,laible_terrain_2013,khan_high_2011,reymann_improving_2015,schilling_geometric_2017, wietrzykowski_context-aware_2019}. Multiple decision trees are created with bootstrapped data sets - randomly selected data sub-sets from a training set. Classification may be determined by the majority results as opposed to the mean \cite{breiman_random_2001,ho_random_1995}. Random Decision Forests may be used to predict road surface area by detecting gravel terrain. Three data bases are conventionally used to train and develop a machine learning algorithm: Training, Testing, and Verification. Training data is the data set from which the Random Decision Forest trains. Training data sets must have roughly equal number of each class to avoid over-training. Training with uneven amounts of data per class type tends to over-classify data as the majority class. Sufficiently large training data sets is necessary to avoid over-training the algorithm to the training data set. Training with a smaller training data set tends to train the algorithm to miss-classify data that does not precisely match the training data set. Testing data is a data set that is independent of the training data but is roughly similar to the training data set. Random Decision Forests do not require a testing data set, as training data is bootstrapped from a larger data set and training data that is not selected may be used as the testing data set. Verification or validation data sets are used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model by providing data that is non-negligibly dissimilar to the training to testing data sets. } 
		
		{MATLAB's Classification Learner Application may be used to generate a Random Decision Forests for each considered scanning LiDAR channel. Decision tree depth, number of learners, and number of features to consider for each binary split are hyper-parameters that may be optimized using MATLAB's Bayesian Optimization.}
		
		
%		{MATLAB provides tree ensemble creation functionality using the $TreeBagger$ library. $TreeBagger$ allows for multiple input arguments effecting the resulting Random Decision Forest. Shown in the following code segment is the input arguments used in creating the RDF for this work.}

%
%		{Number of trees in the RDF may be defined by $NumTrees$. Number of trees may increase accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Accuracy versus number of trees may be tested by calculating out-of-bag and validation error. Training data is given in a table $Training\_Data$ containing all extracted data features. Training data tables must have appropriate headers containing names of used features, but does not contain the class labels. Class labels must be inserted separately, shown in the code block above as $Terrain\_Types$. Class labels must have the same number of rows as the training data table, with each row corresponding to the class that results in the feature values. Table \ref{tab:Training_Data_Example} gives a simplified example of proper formatting of class labels and training data. Maximum number of binary decision splits may be defined in $MaxNumSplits$. Number of bagged features to pull for each individual tree may be defined in $NumPredictorsToSample$. This work followed convention by defining $NumPredictorsToSample$ as the square root of the total number of features. $OOBPredictorImportance$ may be set to $on$ to indicate the storage of out-of-bag estimates of feature importance in the resulting RDF. While this does not effect the resulting RDF, it does serve as a useful post-evaluation tool. $OOBPrediction$ may be defined as $on$ to indicate the storage of out-of-bag information in the RDF. While this does not effect the resulting RDF, it does serve as a useful post-evaluation tool, while eliminating the need to build a separate testing data base. $InBagFraction$ defines the fraction of input data to sample with replacement from the training data set. }

		{Bayesian Optimization may be used to tune the hyper parameters of a machine algorithm \cite{noauthor_bayesian_nodate, snoek_practical_2012}. Bayesian Optimization initializes a surrogate function to represent the objective function (in this case minimum total classification error) with randomly selected hyper-parameters. Additional points on the objective function are chosen using an acquisition function to determine the utility of hyper-parameters.}

	\section{Closing Statements on Related Work}{
		
		{Current road detection models principally rely upon preexisting geometric or visible features. Localization may be completed by comparing a point cloud of a vehicle's local area to a previously built map of the area using Iterative Closest Point. Neither method may suffice for rural environments, where generalized road features do not exist or the creation of maps would be considered impracticable due to storage constraints. LiDAR has been shown to perform successful terrain classification, and may be able to determine road surface area. Regression analysis may be completed with Method of Least-Squares or a RANSAC based method in order to project a plane unto a point cloud, which will serve as a baseline for examining point cloud spatial properties. Random Decision Forest Classification is an established method for LiDAR-based terrain classification using machine learning.}

{
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
		{Detection of unmarked gravel road surfaces using terrain classification requires building a data base of terrain features, training an RDF, and testing the algorithm for accuracy of unmarked road detection (outline of work in Fig. \ref{fig:flowz_2}). The experimental apparatus for this work was the Ohio University Autonomous Van van (Fig. \ref{fig:Experimental_Apperatus}), which has a Velodyne VLP-32C scanning LiDAR sensor, Novatel PwrPak 7D-E2 GNSS and INS system, and Mako cameras. Raw data was gathered using the Robotic Operating System (ROS) to package incoming scanning LiDAR, GNSS, IMU, and camera sensor data as rosbags. Rosbags were unpacked using MATLAB tools to separate data streams. Prior to creating a training database, manual dictation of gravel and asphalt areas of the gathered point cloud data is necessary. In order to do so, all scanning LiDAR data from a rosbag was aggregated in order to create a single point cloud map. Scanning LiDAR timestamps were matched to the closest GNSS and IMU timestamp data. Closest matching GNSS and IMU data informed the location and orientation of the LiDAR scan (Fig. \ref{fig:road_areas_annotated_22}). Compiled point cloud maps was examined and compared to camera and satellite data to determine gravel and asphalt surface location. Manually defined 2D areas representing gravel and asphalt were projected unto the point cloud (Fig. \ref{fig:road_areas_annotated_22}).}

			\label{fig:flowz_2}
		\end{figure}
		
		{Training data was extracted from a single arc from each 360 degree LiDAR scan if the arc was coincident to a manually projected 2D area. Raw spatial and intensity values from the coincident arc were saved to a raw training database. Separate training data bases were maintained for each individual channel. Features that describe the raw spatial and intensity data were extracted. Thirty percent of the training data base was randomly selected and set aside as a validation data base. Training data was visually examined for clustering to verify that a Random Decision Forest would be able to be trained (Fig. \ref{fig:training_data_cluster}). It was found that each class generally clustered to a certain range with some overlap, which indicates that a Random Decision Forest may be trained. MATLAB was used to train a Random Decision Forests for each of the three considered channels using Bayesian Optimization to tune tree depth and number of splits. Training continued until a minimum error was reached (Fig. \ref{fig:c2_min_class_error}). Validation of the RDF was then completed using the validation database.}
		
		{Classification of five rosbags with data gathered from a section of road with three intercepting gravel driveways (one of the gravel driveways was the entrance to the source of the gravel training data). Three arcs from three channels were considered for classification - the centers of the arcs were directly in front of the vehicle, and 45 degrees left and right of center, creating nine total areas in a 3x3 grid in front of the van. Following the same process as aggregating point clouds, GNSS and IMU data informed the location and orientation of the arcs in each 360 degree scan. All arcs were then classified as "asphalt", "gravel", or "unknown", and the averaged coordinates of each arc was aggregated into a single, classified point cloud.}
		
		{Manually defined gravel, asphalt, and side-of-road areas were projected onto the classified point cloud then used to determine the accuracy of the terrain classification algorithm. Classified point clouds were manually examined to determine if the location of gravel and asphalt surfaces may be identified visually. If consecutive points from each channel in any direction had two or more matching gravel or asphalt classification and was evenly spaced, a gravel or road surface area was projected. Guessed road surface areas were then compared to actual areas to determine the method's ability at unmarked gravel road discovery, indicating the method's efficiency at detecting intercepting gravel roads.}

	\section{Objective 1}{
		
		{\textbf{Objective Statement: Explore Identify model of adequately describing and simulating a gravel road.} Physical data of a gravel road and a paved road with an intersecting gravel road was gathered using a sensor platform that includes LiDAR and RGB cameras. Regression analysis projection of two dimensional planes using incoming point cloud data to provide a reference point for spacial analysis was explored. Random Decision Forests was explored for classification of a scanning LiDAR spatial and remission data of a gravel road surface. Completion of Objective 1 was accomplished by achieving the goal of gravel road detection. Success was measured by determining the accuracy of detection and the processing time. The outcome of Objective 1 was a method of detecting a physical gravel road with a LiDAR sensor.}
	
		\subsection{Task 1}{
	
			\textbf{Task 1: }{Collect LiDAR and camera data to characterize gravel and paved roads. Data collection took place at a gated gravel lot maintained by Ohio University's Civil Engineering Department as well as public unmarked chipseal and gravel roads near Athens Ohio. Required data was gathered with the Hexegon Chrysler Pacifica New Eagle DBW van. Velodnyne VLP-32C was used to collect physical data of a gravel and paved road surfaces in order to inform a mathematical model describing the road surface. GNSS+INS provided odometer and telemetry data necessary for processing captured point clouds. Incoming sensor data streams was captured by the onboard Linux-based computer. Robotic Operating System's (ROS) interpreted incoming data and exported to a rosbag file for post processing. MATLAB was used to interpret the recorded rosbag and export point cloud and image. }

LiDAR point cloud data was gathered with the vehicle's roof-mounted Velodyne VLP-32C. Velodnyne's VLP-32C has 32 channels producing 300,000 points per second with a vertical field of view from -45$^{\circ}$ to $+$15$^{\circ}$, providing a minimum 0.33$^{\circ}$ vertical angular resolution and 0.2$^{\circ}$ horizontal angular resolution \cite{vlp_32c}.

			\textbf{Task 2: }{Analyze point cloud data for determining a mathematical model describing a physical gravel road surface. Point cloud data lying on the gravel road surface was manually isolated using MATLAB by defining areas pertaining to one of the four considered terrain types. Establishment of a ground plane using RANSAC or Method of Least Squares was necessary to provide a point of reference for spacial data analysis. Granular examination of scanning LiDAR spatial and remission data was accomplished by discretizing LiDAR channels into quadrants. Features such as mean, median, and roughness that will be used to characterize scanning LiDAR spatial and remission data. Random Decision Forests was explored as a method of terrain classification using features derived from scanning LiDAR spatial and remission data. Verifying the model was completed by scoring classification accuracy against a  data set with known terrain types.}

%				
%				{Projection of a plane was necessary to provide a reference point for describing point variance. RANSAC and Method of Least Squares were tested for use as plane projection methods.

%			
%				{RANSAC was implementing by a built-in MATLAB function, $pcfitplane$. Method of Least Squares was implemented by importing a MATLAB library \cite{noauthor_object-oriented_nodate}. Comparison of computational efficiency between the two methods was accomplished by creating a script that would load a point cloud file and determine the length of time required to project a plane. Comparisons between validation data set classification accuracy and out-of-bag error were made to gauge the performance between the two plane projection methods.}

			\subsubsection{Aggregating Point Cloud Data}\label{sec:aggregating_point_cloud_data}{
			
				{Scanning LiDAR training data requires extraction from manually defined gravel, asphalt, and "unknown" terrain areas on aggregated point clouds as manual extraction from consecutive scans is extremely time consuming. Aggregating LiDAR data into a single point cloud was completed by post processing rosbags that contained scanning LiDAR, GPS, and IMU data of an unmarked road. Scanning LiDAR timestamps were matched to the closest GNSS and IMU timestamp data. Closest matching GNSS and IMU data informed the location and orientation of the LiDAR scan. Point cloud translation and rotation was accomplished using transformation matrices derived from GPS and IMU data. Rotation matrices were created using extracted roll, pitch, and yaw data from the IMU. LiDAR origin was found using GPS longitude, latitude, and altitude data. Physical distances between the GPS, IMU, and LiDAR sensors was rectified by obtaining reference frames provided by AutonomouStuff. GPS coordinates were offset by the current orientation and converted the ground truth to the LiDAR frame. GPS, IMU, and LiDAR reference frames and rotational updates were combined into trajectory vectors. Consecutive point cloud scans may then translated and rotated with derived transformation matrices (Fig. \ref{fig:Compiled_PCD}). While not as robust as more sophisticated methods of point cloud aggregation such as NDT or ICP scan matching, over shorter distances using this method proved to be adequate for this work.}

Spatial features were non-dimensionalized as necessary by dividing by the average range of the arc to LiDAR point of origin to the appropriate power. As remission is a ratio of minimum to maximum detectable reflected intensity there was no need to render the features non-dimensionalized.

				{MATLAB's Classification Learner Application was used to generate a Random Decision Forests for each considered scanning LiDAR channel. Validation methods for the trained model include Hold-out Validation, Cross Validation, and Resubstitution Validation. Hold-out Validation randomly selects a portion of the training data to train and uses the remainder to validate. Cross Validation divides the training data into partitions or folds. A validation partition is selected, and a model is trained using the remaining folds. Validation error is retained and a new validation partition is selected. The process is repeated until each partition was used for validation. The model with highest accuracy is chosen as the resulting model. Resubstitution Validation, the chosen option, uses all the training data for training and initial validation and does not protect against over-fitting, as well as Cross Validation and Hold-out Validation. This may result in an over-estimation of training accuracy, however as a validation data set was previously made and set aside, further tests will determine if the model is over-fit. Resubstitution Validation was chosen to exactly define the testing and validation data sets, as MATLAB randomly determines the training and validation data sets if other options are chosen, reducing reproducibility of results.}
				
				{Random Decision Forest hyper-parameters were tuned to increase terrain classification accuracy. Decision tree depth, number of learners, and number of features to consider for each binary split are hyper-parameters that were optimized using MATLAB's Bayesian Optimization. Bayesian Optimization automates the manual hyper-parameter tuning process by creating a surrogate model representing the objective function, in this case out-of-bag error (Fig. \ref{fig:c2_min_class_error}). Initialization of the objective function is completed by training a number of RDFs using randomly selected hyper-parameters. Out-of-bag error is then found and used to create a series of Gaussian curves. Additional hyper-parameters are chosen by an acquisition function to determine their utility in minimizing out-of-bag error. After a set number of iterations, best hyper-parameters are chosen based minimum upper confidence interval of the classification error objective model. Confusion matrices provide classification accuracy information on training and validation data sets by comparing actual and predicted classes (Fig. \ref{fig:out_of_bag_err_conf_mat}). This process was completed for each of the three considered scanning LiDAR channels used for classification.}

Thirty percent of the training data base was randomly selected and set aside to create the verification data base. Confusion matrices provide classification accuracy information on validation database by classifying each data set in the validation database and comparing actual and predicted classes, resulting in a matrix that visualizes the accuracy for each terrain type as well as which terrain types are more likely to be confused for a different class (Fig. \ref{fig:vali_err_conf_mat_range}).

Employing GPS and IMU data to determine position and orientation respectively, while not as robust as more advance methods such as Iterative Closest Point, was sufficient for analysis of smaller stretches of road. Physical distance between the GPS, IMU, and LiDAR were rectified by measuring the distance between the modules. Reference frames between the GPS, IMU, and LiDAR was completed by applying rotational matrices. Transformation matrices were created by considering the GPS position and the IMU's roll, pitch, and yaw data. Point cloud data was then altered with the resulting transformation matrices, and consecutively stored to an overall point cloud array.}
			
			\subsubsection{Transformation Matrix Derivation} \label{sec:grab_tform} {
			
				{Point cloud translation and rotation was accomplished using transformation matrices that were derived from GPS and IMU data stored in a rosbag. GPS and IMU  time stamps that most closely matched LiDAR timestamps were found. Rotation matrices were created using extracted roll, pitch, and yaw data from the IMU. LiDAR origin was found using GPS longitude, latitude, and altitude data. Physical distances between the GPS, IMU, and LiDAR was rectitude by obtaining reference frames provided by AutonomouStuff (\ref{sec:experimental-apparatus-setup}). GPS coordinates were offset by the current orientation and converts the ground truth to the LiDAR frame. GPS, IMU, and LiDAR reference frames and rotational updates were combined into trajectory vectors. Transformation matrices were then derived using MATLAB's $rigid3d$ function. Consecutive point cloud scans may then translated and rotated with derived transformation matrices (Figure \ref{fig:Compiled_PCD}).}

Point coordinates in each arc were averaged to represent each arc as a single point.

Averaged x, y, and z coordinates were taken of each arc and projected unto a manually defined truth area map (Fig. \ref{fig:rm_db_4_toc}). Classification results that were sympatric to manually defined areas were extracted and examined for accuracy. Accuracy scores was calculated based on the distribution of classified points with each area, allowing evaluation of unmarked road detection performance. Road detection accuracy was determined by scoring the exact terrain classification, true positive road surface detection, and false negative road surface detection. Side-of-road areas were considered for road edge detection. Drop off in positive road surface classification rates in side-of-road areas would be indicative that the random decision forest classification algorithm was adequate at detecting the road edge.}

Point cloud data from the resulting rosbags was manually defined by area as one of three terrain types: gravel, chipseal, or grass. Although this work does not evaluate the detection accuracy of grass, differentiation between a road and non-road surface is necessary for evaluating road-surface detection, therefore grass is labeled as "unknown" in this work.}

		{MATLAB was used to train Random Decision Forest terrain classification algorithms using the Classifier Learner App. Training data was loaded into the application. Validation methods for the trained model include Hold-out Validation, Cross Validation, and Resubstitution Validation. Resubstitution Validation, the chosen option, uses all the training data for training and initial validation and does not protect against over-fitting, as MATLAB randomly determines the training and validation data sets if other options are chosen, reducing reproducibility of results. Random Decision Forest hyper-parameters were tuned to increase terrain classification accuracy. Decision tree depth, number of learners, and number of features to consider for each binary split are hyper-parameters that were optimized using MATLAB's Bayesian Optimization. Bayesian Optimization automates the manual hyper-parameter tuning process by creating a surrogate model representing the objective function, in this case out-of-bag error (Figure \ref{fig:c2_min_class_error}, \ref{fig:c2_min_class_error_ransac}, \ref{fig:c2_min_class_error_mls}). Testing for over-fitting was accomplished by comparing out-of-bag training error to validation error (Figure \ref{fig:train_vs_valid_overfit_test2}, \ref{fig:train_vs_vali_ransac}, \ref{fig:train_vs_vali_mls}). Confusion matrices provide validation database classification accuracy information by classifying each data set in the validation database and comparing actual and predicted classes (Figure \ref{fig:vali_err_conf_mat_range} \ref{fig:c2_vali_conf_ransac} \ref{fig:c2_vali_confmat_mls}).}

		{Classifying consecutive LiDAR scans was accomplished by examination of the nine arcs of interest in front and forty-five degree angles left and right from the front of the experimental apparatus (Fig. \ref{fig:area_example}). Features from each arc were extracted and the arc was classified (Figure \ref{fig:range_raw_results_example}). Classification of real-world data outside of the training data set presents difficulties to the generated Random Decision Forest Classifiers generated in this work. Due to the side of the road was being re-grassed near a portion of the asphalt road, the terrain classification algorithm struggled to differentiate the dirt from gravel, leading to some miss-classification of the side-of-road areas. Examination of the feature distribution shows a high amount of overlap (Fig. \ref{fig:dirt_v_gravel2}). Exploitation of confidence scores to adjust results by requiring a very high confidence for positive gravel surface classification was explored, as the dirt area had a higher level . All gravel surfaces that did not meet a 80\% confidence score was re-labeled as "unknown", however these adjustment had either a negligible or detrimental impact on the final results as higher confidence score requirements resulted in "unknown" over-classification and too low resulted in "gravel" over-classification. Training a terrain classification algorithm to re-classify any gravel classification as either "unknown" or "gravel" was explored. Training data from the dirt area was gathered as in the method described in \ref{sec:training-data-collection} and used to train an RDF in the method described in \ref{sec:rdf_train_verify}. }

Overall average distribution for "unknown" terrain class within side-of-road areas was found to be 77.94\%. Other algorithms performed similarly to each other in terms of gravel and asphalt true-positive classification rate, however there \textbf{RANGE} exhibits a substantial increase when detecting side-of-road areas.

As the closest channel was the most effected by the confusion, the closest channel was re-examined initially for proof of concept. Although the true side-of-road detection rate (Figure \ref{fig:area_score_comp}) did improve (15.38\% increase in side-of-road detection), it came with increased false-negatives in gravel terrain discovery in addition to increased computational load. Original results (Figure \ref{fig:db_4_raw_range_2}) show side of road areas having a distribution majority of unknown classifications, indicating that the additional classification algorithm may not be needed to detect side-of-road areas.}

		{Classified point clouds were manually examined for 'best guess' locations for gravel and asphalt surfaces. Two out of three positive gravel identifications must be made on each channel, be evenly spaced, and be relatively co-planar to other road surface guesses in order for a positive guess for an asphalt or gravel surface to be made (Fig. \ref{fig:rm_db_4_toc}). Using the \textbf{RANGE} algorithm, driveways $1$ and $2$ were detected in all five drive-bys, driveway $3$ was detected in four leading to an 91.67\% accuracy in intercepting gravel road detection. It was found that in three drive-bys there was a false positive driveway detection, however the location of the false-positives were not repeated in any of the other drive-bys. In all drive-bys the asphalt road was accurately detected.}

	\section{Rate of Classification}{
		
		{Classification was completed using Ubuntu 18.04 and an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12 core 24 thread. Rate of classification for all nine areas of interest in a single scan was found to be an average of 35.19 ms using a single core (Fig. \ref{fig:per_arc_classification_time}) or 316.68 ms per 360 degree scan (Fig. \ref{fig:per_scan_classification_rate}). Further optimization may increase this speed, however real-time classification is not a focus of this work. When utilizing all 24 cores during this indicates that a rate of 13.19 ms per 360 scan. Extrapolating from the distance traveled during a drive-by, a hypothetical 71.39 feet per second or 48.68 miles per hour may be possible.}

\chapter{Conclusion}
{
	
	{The proposed work addresses the problem of road surface detection on unmarked gravel and chipseal roads. Current LiDAR and Camera based detection models are insufficient due to lack of distinct features typical of urban roads, such as painted line markings or curbs, or have excessive computational or storage requirements. The completed work balanced accuracy and efficiency by using less intensive analysis techniques of smaller point cloud data sets. The first objective was to determine a method of detecting an unmarked gravel road. The second objective was to evaluate performance of road detection along stretches of unmarked gravel and chipseal roads. The final deliverable of the completed work was a method of detecting physical unmarked gravel and chipseal roads by using a terrain classification approach to predicting road surface area. The impact of this work is that autonomous vehicles using LiDAR may be able to detect gravel road surfaces in real time, allowing autonomous operations on 1.5 million miles of previously undetected rural roads.}
